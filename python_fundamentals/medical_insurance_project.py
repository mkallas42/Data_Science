Python Syntax: Medical Insurance Project.

Suppose you are a medical professional curious about how certain factors contribute to medical insurance costs. 
Using a formula that estimates a personâ€™s yearly insurance costs, you will investigate how different factors such as 
age, sex, BMI, etc. affect the prediction.
